**Skills Gained**

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- SQL for Data Management
- Visualization in Power BI/Tableau

**Project Background**

Global Electronics, a leading retailer in the consumer electronics market, has accumulated datasets covering various aspects of its business, including customer demographics, product details, sales records, store operations, and currency exchange rates. The companyâ€™s goal is to leverage this data for strategic decision-making to increase operational efficiency, improve customer experiences, and optimize financial performance.

**Problem Statement**

To aid Global Electronics in harnessing its data, the project focuses on:

- Conducting thorough EDA to uncover valuable business insights.
- Identifying patterns in customer purchasing behavior, product popularity, store performance, and the effect of currency fluctuations on sales.
- Formulating data-driven recommendations for marketing, inventory planning, sales forecasting, and store expansion strategies.

**Approach and Methodology**

**1\. Data Collection and Preprocessing**

- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, corrected data types, and ensured consistency across columns (e.g., currency and dates).
- **Data Integration**: Merged datasets to create a unified dataset (final_df) containing relevant information about customers, products, sales, stores, and exchange rates.

**2\. Data Management Using SQL**

- **Database Setup**: Created tables in SQL for each data source, ensuring referential integrity and efficient querying.
- **Data Loading**: Loaded cleaned datasets into the SQL database, including tables for customers, products, sales, stores, and exchange rates.
- **SQL Queries**: Formulated 10 SQL queries to extract insights for analysis (provided below).

**3\. Power BI Visualization**

- Connected SQL database to Power BI to import the data.
- Created a dashboard to visualize the following:
  - **Customer Analysis**: Age distribution, purchasing frequency, and product preferences.
  - **Sales Trends**: Seasonal and product-wise sales trends.
  - **Product Analysis**: Top products, profitability, and category distribution.
  - **Store Analysis**: Store performance by sales per square meter and location.

**Business Use Cases**

1. **Customer Analysis**: Understand demographic distributions and purchasing patterns to improve customer satisfaction and segment customers effectively.
2. **Sales Analysis**: Analyze overall sales trends, evaluate product and store performance, and assess the impact of currency exchange rates.
3. **Product Analysis**: Determine popular and profitable products, analyze category-wise performance, and suggest potential areas for product development.
4. **Store Analysis**: Examine store performance by size, region, and operational data to recommend store expansion, closure, or optimization.

**Data Sources**

The project utilizes the following datasets:

- **Customer Data**: Demographic details (e.g., age, gender, location).
- **Product Data**: Details on product categories, pricing, and costs.
- **Sales Data**: Transaction records detailing dates, quantities, product IDs, and associated stores.
- **Store Data**: Store-specific information, such as location, size, and opening dates.
- **Currency Data**: Exchange rates to assess international sales impacts.

**Analysis Steps**

**Customer Analysis**

- **Demographic Distribution**: Analyze gender, age, and location to understand the customer base.
- **Purchase Patterns**: Identify average order values, purchase frequency, and product preferences.
- **Segmentation**: Group customers based on demographics and purchasing behavior.

**Sales Analysis**

- **Overall Sales Performance**: Track total sales over time to identify trends and seasonality.
- **Sales by Product**: Identify top-selling products by quantity and revenue.
- **Sales by Store**: Evaluate stores based on sales data.
- **Sales by Currency**: Assess the impact of currency fluctuations on sales.

**Product Analysis**

- **Product Popularity**: Rank products by popularity based on sales data.
- **Profitability Analysis**: Calculate and compare profit margins across products.
- **Category Analysis**: Evaluate sales across different product categories.

**Store Analysis**

- **Store Performance**: Assess stores based on size, sales, and operational tenure.
- **Geographical Analysis**: Identify high-performing regions and assess potential for expansion.

**Results**

Upon project completion, a comprehensive EDA report was generated. This report includes:

- **Customer Demographics and Segmentation**: Understanding the age, gender, location, and purchasing patterns of various customer segments.
- **Sales Trends**: Seasonal patterns and product performance insights.
- **Product Performance**: Analysis of top-performing products, profitable categories, and product popularity.
- **Store Operations and Regional Insights**: Identifying high-performing stores and sales per square meter.
- **Currency Impact**: Evaluating how currency fluctuations impact international sales.

**Deliverables**

The final deliverables include:

- **SQL Database**: A structured database containing cleaned and preprocessed data tables.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: An interactive Power BI dashboard visualizing customer, sales, product, and store insights.
- **EDA Report**: A detailed report summarizing insights with visualizations and actionable recommendations for Global Electronics.

**Key Recommendations**

Based on the findings, the following recommendations were made:

1. **Targeted Marketing Campaigns**: Develop campaigns targeting key customer demographics based on identified segments.
2. **Inventory Optimization**: Focus inventory on high-demand products and regions.
3. **Profitability Focus**: Prioritize products with high profit margins in marketing and sales strategies.
4. **Store Expansion Strategy**: Invest in high-performing regions and assess underperforming stores.
5. **Currency Risk Management**: Implement currency hedging or adjust pricing strategies based on exchange rate trends.

**Conclusion**

Through the DataSpark project, Global Electronics gains access to a robust analytical framework that empowers data-driven decision-making. The insights generated from the analysis aim to enhance customer satisfaction, boost operational efficiency, and support the company's growth strategy.
